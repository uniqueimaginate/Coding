## Algorithmic_Problem_Solving_Strategies(알고리즘 문제해결 전략)    

This book is the most famous Algorithm book at Korea.

In this book, you can study lots of algorithms practically. The code in this directory is my code history studying the book.

   1. multiple_for.cpp
   2. boggle.cpp
   3. picnic.cpp

2. Divide & Conquer
   1. fastSum.cpp
   2. matrixMultiplication.cpp
   3. mergeSort.cpp
   4. quickSort.cpp

3. Dynamic Programming (DP)
   1. binominal.cpp
   2. jumpgame.cpp
   3. wildcard.cpp - <b>It was difficult to me</b>

4. Linear DataStructure
   1. dynamicArray.cpp
   2. josephus.cpp
