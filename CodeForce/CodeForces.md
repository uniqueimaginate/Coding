Accepted : A, B  
Tried : C  
Cannot Tried: D, E1, E2, F  

<b>During Contest</b><br>First time tried live contest. A, B is easy to solve, but from C I couldn't figure out which algorithm to solve it. First, I thought brute force but I cannot think how to implement it. 

<b>After Contest</b><br>
Problem C - Brute Force was right! I checked other code and learned how to solve it.
