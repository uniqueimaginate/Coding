## Algorithmic_Problem_Solving_Strategies(알고리즘 문제해결 전략)    

This book is the most famous Algorithm book at Korea.

In this book, you can study lots of algorithms practically. The code in this directory is my code history studying the book.

1. Brute force  
Peronally, I think implementing brute force using dfs and recursive is important.
   1. multiple_for.cpp
   2. boggle.cpp
   3. picnic.cpp  
      how to pair, remove duplicated  
   4. boardcover.cpp  
      모양을 배열상에서 회전하는 방법, input 이 문자여도 이를 숫자로 바꾸어서 해결하는 법
   5. tsp.cpp (using brute force, only available when the number of cities is low)

2. Divide & Conquer
   1. fastSum.cpp
   2. matrixMultiplication.cpp
   3. mergeSort.cpp
   4. quickSort.cpp
   5. quadtree.cpp
      구현하는 아이디어가 매우 참신하다고 생각, string stl 을 잘 사용한다.

3. Dynamic Programming (DP)
   1. binominal.cpp
   2. jumpgame.cpp
   3. wildcard.cpp - <b>It was difficult to me</b>

4. Linear DataStructure
   1. dynamicArray.cpp
   2. josephus.cpp

5. Stack, Queue, Deque
   1. brackets2.cpp

6. Tree
   1. tree.cpp
   2. traversal.cpp
   3. fortress.cpp(continue) - <b>It was difficult to me</b>

7. Segment Tree
   1. rmq.cpp


8. Trie
   1. trie.cpp
